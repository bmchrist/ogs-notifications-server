# Test Structure for OGS Notifications Server

## Organized Test Files

The test suite has been organized into focused, well-structured files for better maintainability:

### 📁 Test Files

```
├── main.go                    # Main server code
├── security_test.go          # 🔒 Critical security tests
├── functionality_test.go     # ⚡ Core functionality tests
├── storage_test.go           # 💾 Storage and persistence tests
├── run_tests.sh             # 🚀 Test runner script
└── TEST_STRUCTURE.md        # 📖 This documentation
```

### 🔒 Security Tests (`security_test.go`)

**Critical security validations:**
- **Input validation** - SQL injection, path traversal, command injection
- **Error sanitization** - No sensitive data exposure in responses
- **XSS prevention** - Script injection protection
- **URL encoding** - Malicious payload handling

### ⚡ Functionality Tests (`functionality_test.go`)

**Core application features:**
- **Registration endpoint** - Device registration validation
- **Turn detection logic** - New vs old turn detection
- **Notification deduplication** - Prevents spam notifications
- **Concurrent operations** - Thread safety verification
- **Diagnostics endpoint** - Status and debug information

### 💾 Storage Tests (`storage_test.go`)

**Data integrity and persistence:**
- **Storage persistence** - Save/load functionality
- **File permissions** - Secure file access (0600)
- **Concurrent access** - Race condition prevention
- **Storage migration** - Old to new format compatibility
- **Corruption handling** - Graceful recovery
- **Performance testing** - Large dataset handling

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Quick Test Run
```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

### Individual Test Categories
```bash
# Security tests only
go test -v -run="TestInputValidation|TestErrorResponse|TestXSS"

# Functionality tests only
go test -v -run="TestRegistration|TestTurnDetection|TestNotification"

# Storage tests only
go test -v -run="TestStorage|TestFile|TestConcurrent"
```

### All Tests
```bash
go test -v
```

### Test Coverage
```bash
go test -cover
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

### ✅ Currently Tested
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error response security
- Device registration flow
- Turn detection accuracy
- Storage persistence
- Concurrent access safety
- File permission security

### 🔄 Tests Show Implementation Needs
- Device token format validation
- Request size limits
- Content-type validation
- Rate limiting
- Authentication mechanisms

## 🎯 Test Philosophy

### Security-First Testing
- **Demonstrate vulnerabilities** - Tests show what should be validated
- **Document requirements** - Tests serve as security specifications
- **Regression prevention** - Catch security regressions early
- **Implementation guides** - Clear examples of proper validation

### Maintainable Structure
- **Focused files** - Each file covers specific functionality
- **Clear naming** - Test names describe exact behavior
- **Comprehensive coverage** - Critical paths thoroughly tested
- **Performance aware** - Tests include performance considerations

## 🔧 Adding New Tests

When adding new features, create tests in the appropriate file:

1. **Security concerns** → `security_test.go`
2. **API endpoints** → `functionality_test.go`
3. **Data operations** → `storage_test.go`

### Test Template
```go
func TestNewFeature(t *testing.T) {
    setupTestStorage()
    defer cleanupTestStorage()

    // Test implementation
    // Include both positive and negative cases
    // Verify security aspects
    // Check error handling
}
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Current Test Behavior
- Tests demonstrate **current behavior**, not ideal behavior
- Many security tests pass but show **gaps that need fixing**
- Tests serve as **requirements documentation** for security improvements

### Production Readiness
- All tests pass ✅
- Security gaps identified 🔍
- Implementation roadmap clear 🗺️
- Ready for security hardening 🛡️

The test suite provides a solid foundation for implementing the remaining security features while ensuring no regressions occur during development.
